# Peer Support Chat Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Real-time Message Synchronization
**Problem**: Messages were not reflecting in real-time when received from other users.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the Supabase real-time subscription filter to properly listen for messages between two specific users
- Added proper subscription cleanup when switching between peers
- Implemented error handling and automatic retry for failed subscriptions
- Added connection status indicator to show real-time connection state

### 2. Scroll Issues
**Problem**: Chat scroll behavior was jarring and didn't preserve user's scroll position.

**Solution**:
- Added scroll position detection to determine if user is near bottom
- Implemented smart auto-scroll that only scrolls when user is near bottom
- Added "New Messages" notification when user is scrolled up and new messages arrive
- Improved scroll behavior with smooth transitions
- Added manual scroll-to-bottom button for new message notifications

### 3. Message Handling Improvements
**Problem**: Poor user experience with message sending and receiving.

**Solution**:
- Implemented optimistic updates for immediate message display
- Added visual feedback for messages being sent ("sending..." status)
- Added notification sound for incoming messages
- Improved error handling with user-friendly error messages
- Added proper cleanup for subscriptions and state
